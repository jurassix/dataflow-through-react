# how react will see your code

React applications are React Component compositions. Much like HTML, React is hierarchical and expressed easily as a tree.

A React Component would look like the following:

* Root - entry point into our application
* Children typically top level layouts
 * Menu
 * Footer
 * Side bar
 * Main Section
* Each node is a distinct Component that produces a render fragment
