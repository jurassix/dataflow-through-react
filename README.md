# Introduction

In order to build well architected React components we need to understand how data flows through our React applications. This will enable us to look under the abstractions of modern FLUX architectures and understand the tools available to build a complex reactive application.

This is modern guide to understanding how data flows through React applications and to structure your React components for reusability with any FLUX framework or next-gen pattern.

* Investigate how react will see our components
* Examine how data flows through a React application
* What are the current best practices for React data propagation
* What patterns are in the wild

Assumptions:
* _All examples assume ES6 and React 14_
